## Calendar

The Calendar page provides a view of different tasks, their associated **due date**, and **status**.

Tasks displayed on the calendar can be filtered here to view “**My Tasks**” - tasks assigned specifically to you - and “**All Tasks**” - tasks relating to all users.

At a ‘**Superuser**’ level, you can drag and drop tasks across the calendar to different dates, assigning them to different users.

You can traverse through months using the forward and backward arrows above the calendar on the top right.

:::important note
**Subtasks** are currently differentiated from **parent tasks** on the calendar with a preceding(s).
