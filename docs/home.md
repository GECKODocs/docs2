## Navigation Menu

To get started, the first thing to do while familiarising yourself with the GECKO platform is to **explore** the **navigation menu** and work your way around the different areas of functionality.

The menu can be hidden using the hamburger menu as a toggle' menu on/off' button.

## Main Dashboard

- **Open Tasks** - Number of open tasks on the platform. Task visibility is based on user permissions.
- **Completed Tasks** - Number of complete tasks on the platform. Task visibility is based on user permissions.
- **Manage** fund Categories, Workflows and Users.
- **Filter** by Project   
  - R.A.G Rating (Red, Amber, Green) piechart aggregation, filtering on Task Status within a specified Fund   or Project. i.e. A centralised, birdseye view of tasks that are Complete, In Progress or Overdue. Task visibility is based on user permissions.

## Activities Pie Chart

You can **hover your mouse** over the **pie chart** to view the **number of tasks** Overdue, In Progress and Completed. Click on the pie chart to be brought to the underlying collection of tasks.

E.g. If you select ‘**Overdue**’, you are directed to the ‘**Tasks**’ page, where you can view all Overdue tasks in your selected Project.

Use the various filter functions or search functionality to optimise your search. You can then review individual tasks by clicking the link in the **Name** column. 

:::tip tip
This pie chart is an example of a simple KPI. We can work with you to customise different graph types to help you gain maximum efficiency using the GECKO platform.

## Task Status Timeline

A new Dashboard **stacked** graph that displays a status aggregation of all tasks across all Projects, based on their Due Date.

You can **click** on a particular status colour to view the underlying tasks in any of the graph columns.

You can **filter** the graph by status using the status selectors above the graph.


:::note note
Task visibility will depend on your permission level.
Only an admin can turn the graph on or off in the workspace settings.
