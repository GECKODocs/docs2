## Create a Task

Click ‘**Add Task**’ within a workflow stage and enter the relevant information.

:::tip tip
You can use the task **Period** field to specify the **period of time the work relates to**. This enables you to search for and report on the task based on **when the work was carried out**, rather than on the Due Date of the task.
:::

:::tip tip
**Priority**: We recommend using a priority level of **Medium for normal, day-to-day tasks**. Low and High priority can then be used accordingly. **Critical** would ideally be used on the **rare occasion** that a task merits such a priority. If the term Critical becomes overused - the word loses its meaning!

## Subtasks
A subtask is just like a **regular task** and has all the same fields and functionality, except for ‘Repetition Time’.

Create a subtask by clicking ‘**Add Subtask**’.

**When should I create a subtask?**

- When you have a **large bucket of work** or group of related processes that **can be broken down** into more manageable **chunks of work**.
- When you have an **umbrella or parent task** that can **remain open for a long duration** of time and subtasks that occur on an ad hoc basis.


On the GECKO platform, you **won’t be able to close the parent task until all underlying subtasks have been marked as Complete**.

## Recurring Tasks

The GECKO platform allows you to create an individual task that recurs at specified time intervals.

**When should I create a recurring task?**

In contrast to the subtask functionality, you would use a recurring task if **you have a task or business process whereby similar work is carried out at regular intervals**. E.g. filing a report to the Central Bank every month. 

**How do I create a recurring task?**

 Create a recurring task by **setting a Repetition Time** when creating a task. E.g. Repetition Time - Weekly

**How do I trigger the task to recur?**

A task will automatically recur or repeat in two scenarios:

When the Due Date has been reached..

**OR**

By completing a task..

:::important note 
The current Parent-Subtask structure is maintained in the next iteration of a recurring series of tasks.
:::

If the due date has been reached OR you have clicked Complete on a task, then **a new task will automatically be created with a new adjusted due date**.

## Checklists
We recommend the use of **checklists** where the full functionality of a task is not needed.

Checklists allow you to break down tasks into smaller, actionable items.

Once you build out your checklist structure, you can then **assign items** to the relevant resources.


## Tags
Tags are a core part of the GECKO platform.

They enhance your ability to **locate, aggregate and report** on work carried out across the platform.

Click into any task and navigate to the Tag section to label that task with a Tag.

#### Example use cases:

- **Red Flag**
  Tag a task as a Red Flag issue and keep track of progress via the KPI filter sets.
- **Reviewed**
- **Issue Found**
- **No Issue Found**

Use the above example Tags when dealing with any issues that may have arisen from a task. 

Again, these tagged tasks can be aggregated and presented at a board or committee meeting. Used in conjunction with task comments, this can be a powerful way of streamlining your reporting function.
