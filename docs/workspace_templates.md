## Workspace Templates

Templates are intended to be like a *blueprint* for **Workspaces**. You can think of them as cookie cutters. The Workspaces you create with them are the cookies.

You can create a Template in the same way as you would a Workspace.
Click Add Workspace and select the Template checkbox.

Alternatively, you can edit a Workspace and mark it as a Template.
