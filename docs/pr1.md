:::tip best practise
The Checklist / To-Do list functionality allows you to assign specific users to an individual checklist item.
:::

**Tags**
You can add multiple Tags to a task. This powerful functionality makes it easy to search for or aggregate across tasks for reporting purposes.

<img alt="Drag Tasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/tag&Upload.png')}/>

:::important note 
To insert a link in the **Description** field first highlight the word/s you wish to contain the link, then click on the link icon on the top right of the Description field. From here click the **Insert link** button. You will be provided with 4 textboxes - **URL, Text, Title, Target**. Paste/type your link into the URL textbox. The **Text** textbox is the highlighted text that contains your hyperlink. The other 2 fields can be left blank. Click **Confirm** to insert your link.
To open a link that is already present right click and click 'Open Link in New Tab'.
:::

**Task Audit Trail**
Each task has its own audit trail which tracks all updates made to that specific task.

:::important Note
Audit trail stores all the addition and edit ever made to any project/task. There's a seperate tab available too if wish to just obtain audits on different project/task.
:::

<img alt="Drag Tasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/auditTrail.png')}/>

## Sub Tasks
A subtask is essentially just like a **regular task** and has all the same fields and functionality, except for ‘Repetition Time’.

You can create a subtask by clicking on ‘Add New Sub-task’ and following the steps above for creating a task.

**When should I create a subtask?**

You would create one or more subtasks on a parent task in a scenario where you have a **large bucket of work or group of related processes that can be broken down into more manageable chunks of work**.

On the GECKO platform, you **won’t be able to close the parent task until all underlying subtasks have been marked as Complete**.

<img alt="Subtasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/subtasks.png')}/>

## Recurring Tasks

The GECKO platform allows you to create an individual task that recurs at specified time intervals. 

**When should I create a recurring task?**

In contrast to the subtask functionality, you would use a recurring task if **you have a task or business process whereby similar work is carried out at frequent regular intervals**. E.g. filing a report to the Central Bank every month. 

**How do I create a recurring task?**

A task becomes a recurring task once you **select a Repetition Time when creating the task**. E.g. Repetition Time - Weekly.

**How do I trigger the task to recur?**

A task will automatically recur or repeat in two scenarios:

When the Due Date has been reached..

**OR**

When I click Complete on the task..

:::important note 
It’s worth noting here that if the original task contained any subtasks, the **same structure of ‘Parent task and its Subtasks’ will be created in the new task**.
:::

If the due date has been reached OR you have clicked Complete on a task, then **a new task will automatically be created with a new adjusted due date**. 

:::warning warning 
As the new task gets created, the previous task automatically gets **archived** and will be **removed** from the Project Workflow Stage, or column.
:::

## Archived Tasks

A task gets archived only if it has been set up as a recurring task and the **due date has been reached** or an **assignee of the task has clicked Complete**.

**How do I view Archived Tasks?**

You can view an archived task by clicking on the **current or ‘in progress’ task in a recurring series of tasks**, then clicking on the ‘Previous Archived’ tab.


## Workflows

Workflows give companies the opportunity to **examine their internal processes** and group them into **baskets or collections of related tasks**.

On the GECKO platform, we encourage our clients to sit down and take the time to **evaluate their internal business processes** and **group them into similar baskets**. These baskets become the ‘**Workflow Stages**’. In this way a task is generally only moved to another column after initial setup if it is more appropriate to group it in a different basket of work. 

You can create workflows by clicking the ‘**Add Workflow**’ button.

You can also Edit/Delete existing workflows.

All projects are created using workflows, you can use a workflow as a template when creating new Projects.

## Categories

A Category is essentially a '**type**' of **Project**. On the Browse Projects screen you can *filter **Projects** by Category*. 

Within the Categories section you can also create the milestones associated with your projects.

You can Add new Categories or update and delete existing Categories.


## Statuses

You can add new Task Statuses by clicking ‘**Add Status**’.

Filter your status search by using the search functionality.


## Clients

You can add new Clients by clicking ‘**Add Client**’.

Filter your client search by using the search functionality.


## Tag Management

You can add new Tags by clicking ‘**Add Tag**’.

Filter your tag search by using the search functionality.
