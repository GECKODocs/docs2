## Workspace Archiving

You can Archive a Workspace by clicking the **Workspace Options dropdown** and selecting ‘**Archive Workspace**’. An Archived label will be displayed on the Workspace.

The tasks within your Archived Workspace will now remain in a **Read-Only** state until the Workspace is Unarchived. The tasks will no longer show up across the application or be included in reporting, i.e. on the Dashboard, on the Tasks quick finder tab, etc.

**How do I view Archived Workspace?**

You can view all Archived Workspace by navigating to **Browse Workspace** and clicking ‘**Archive**’.

**How do I Unarchive a Workspace?**

You can Unarchive a Workspace by clicking the **Workspace Options dropdown** and selecting ‘**Unarchive Workspace**’.
