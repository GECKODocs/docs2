## Task Filter


On the Activity page you will see a number of input boxes and drop down menus for specifying how you want to filter tasks within the system.

Here you can specify which project you want to ***search*** within.

You can search for the name of the activity if it’s known. 

You can also choose from a drop down list of tags to find tasks with specific tags. 

You can search by task status i.e. **Overdue**, In ***Progress***, ***Complete***. 

It is also possible to search for tasks which have a due date within a given time window, set between a given ‘From’ and ‘To’ date.

There is also an option to **search for archived tasks** only.

Click the ’Find Tasks’ button to show the tasks you have searched for.

**OR**

You can filter and search for tasks across a range of criteria, which include:
- **Project**
- **Task Name**
- **Tags**
- **Task Status i.e. Overdue, In Progress, Complete**
- **Due date range**
  - On clicking the ‘Due date FROM’ or ‘Due date TO’ field you will be given a calendar from   which you can select your date.

On scrolling down the page you will find the results of your search. 

Click the ‘**My Tasks Only**’ slider to filter the results to include only tasks that have been specifically assigned to you.

:::caution caution
While searching for the **overdue** task please avoid using dates since the trigger only runs on the due date of tasks and make it pointless for the need to input date and preventing the no results found.

Below is the result of a particular search. Here you can choose the amount of activity entries shown per page by clicking on the dropdown ‘**Show 10 entries**’.

## Task Search

You can further **refine your search** by entering a **specific phrase in the search box** on the right titled ‘Search’.  You can **search using Task Name, Project Name**, and **Tags** here as well.

The Task Due Date, Task Priority, Task Name, Project Name, Project Stage, Task Status, Task Archive Status, Milestone, and Task Creator are all returned in the result.

The last column is titled ‘**Action**’. From here you can either **delete** a task by clicking the red **x** icon or you can **view** and **edit** the task by clicking the green **pencil** icon.

You can traverse through each page of results using the Previous and Next buttons on the bottom right.

On clicking the ✏️icon of the desired task using searching capabilities is the quickest way to find and edit the task.
