## Audits

On the Audits page, you can view all **actions** and **updates** that have been carried out across all Projects by any user.

A full audit trail of activity is available for each Project/Fund/Task with **time stamped** data on the work that was carried out.

The audit trail can be exported to **csv** and **pdf** format for reporting purposes.
