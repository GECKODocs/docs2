## Recent Projects

This area allows for quick access to the four most recent Projects you have created or that you have been added to.


## Task Finder

The Dashboard Task Finder allows you to perform a **quick search across tasks**. Task visibility is based on user permissions. Tasks can be filtered across various criteria including Due Date, Task Name, Project, Task Status, etc. 

The user can then **drill down to action a specific task**.
