#### Display
By default, the Summary tab displays all tasks returned in the Table tab, sorted by task status.

In the Display dropdown, you can choose to view all tasks sorted by Status or by User. 

#### Group
By default, the Group dropdown is set to None.

Selecting an option in the **Group dropdown** will group the results of the Display dropdown.

Without selecting any high level filters, sort by Status in the Display dropdown and group by Project in Group dropdown.

A set of graphs of all tasks by status, across all projects will be displayed.


## Filter Sets

If you find yourself often returning to search for tasks using the same criteria, you can create a filter set. Each filter set will be **updated in real time** with tasks that meet your specified criteria.

To **create** a filter set, simply enter your search criteria and click **Save**.

To view the retrieved tasks, click on a filter set.


:::tip Tip
Filter sets are at the core of what makes up the Reporting Engine and Dashboard KPIs. The filter sets you create can be added to the dashboard or used to build up sections of a report.
