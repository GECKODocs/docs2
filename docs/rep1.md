## General Overview 

The GECKO Platform provides a number of **useful reports out of the box** to get you up and running. However, our reporting functionalities are frequently being updated.

:::important NOTE
If you have any specific reporting requirements, we’d be happy to talk through your use cases.
:::


## Task Reports

The Task Reports allow you to **generate reports displaying task status** within a specified project or assigned to a specific user.

Simply select a project or user and click ‘**Generate**’.


## Outstanding Task Reports

You can **generate reports displaying any outstanding tasks** across a specific project or assigned to a specific user. 

This allows you to **action a task if a particular user is overloaded** at a given point in time.

Simply select your chosen project or user - **choose a file format** and click ‘**Generate**’.


## Project Audit Report

Using the Project Audit Report, you can g**enerate a report that displays an audit trail of all activity** or updates that were made to a specific project. 

Select a project, choose a file format, optionally select a Date Range and click ‘**Generate**’.

## Tasks by Tag Report

Using the Tasks by Tag report you can **aggregate across one or more Tag(s) in the system**.  

Select a project, choose a file format, optionally select a Date Range and click ‘**Generate**’.

:::tip tip 
While using the .pdf format you can click on a task in the report and you will be brought to the Task View screen for that specific task.

## Tasks due within
(Projects Threshold) - **this is subject to change**

Using the ‘Tasks due within’ report, you can **view a list of tasks due within a specified number of days**.

For example, you can enter the number 3 in the fields, select a file format and generate a report displaying all tasks due within the next 3 days.
