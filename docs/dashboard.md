## Tasks by Project

You can **hover your mouse** over the **pie chart** to view the number of  **Overdue, In Progress and Completed** tasks. Click on the pie chart to be brought to the underlying collection of tasks.

E.g. If you select ‘**Overdue**’, you are directed to the ‘**Tasks**’ page, where you can view all Overdue tasks in your selected Project.

You can **filter** the graph by status using the status selectors above the graph.
