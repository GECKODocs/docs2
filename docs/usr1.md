## User Roles
Here you can set up new users and set different user permissions/roles.

The user menu gives you the option to **Browse users, View System roles, Project roles,** and **Groups**.

## Browse Users

The Users dashboard displays the number of users, and their aliases in the system.

You can **Add**, **Edit** and **Remove** users.
