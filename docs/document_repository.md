## Folder Structure

The Document Repository allows you to access and download digitally stored documents.

Documents are stored within a folder structure. You can **quickly drill down to find the documents** you require.


**How do I access the Document Repository?**

On the **Document Repository** tab on the main navigation. To find specific files or documents you first **select a Project** and then **select the specific task** that the documents relate to.

All documentation uploaded to that task will be displayed.

**Note**: Task visibility is based on user permissions.
