## Update Tasks

You can **click** on a task to view it.

When you're on the Task View screen, you can make updates by clicking on a specific field then clicking the Tick to save your changes. Tooltips have been added to help you update the different fields.

You can access previously archived tasks linked to the one you are working on, in the left-hand panel.

Depending on your permission level, you can update and view the following:

- **Title - Name**

**Description**
All the additional details relating to a task in a project can go in here, which includes links,
references and other texts.

To insert a **link** in the **Description** field:
- Click on the **link icon** in the Description menu bar and select **Insert link**
- Copy and paste link URL into the **URL textbox**
- In the Text field, type the link text as you want it to appear in the Description
- Click **Confirm** to save your link


**File Upload**
You can upload any files / documents related to the task by simply ‘**dragging and dropping**’ or clicking ‘**Drop files here to upload**’.

**Discussion**
You can leave a comment on the bottom of the Task View screen, that all users assigned to the task can read.

**Checklist / To-Do List**
As mentioned above, you can create a Checklist / To-Do List within the task to track smaller related items.

:::tip best practise
The Checklist / To-Do list functionality allows you to assign specific users to an individual checklist item.
:::

**Tags** 
You can add multiple tags to a task. This powerful functionality makes it easy to search for or aggregate across tasks for reporting purposes.

<img alt="Drag Tasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/tag&Upload.png')}/>


**Calls** 
Schedule video conferencing meetings for your Board meetings.

**Task Audit Trail**
Each task has its own audit trail which tracks all updates made to that specific task.

:::important Note
The Audit trail stores all keystrokes and updates ever made to a Project/Task.  A separate Audit menu item tab is available if you wish to obtain a more comprehensive Audit across all Projects.
:::

<img alt="Drag Tasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/auditTrail.png')}/>

## Sub Tasks
A subtask is essentially just like a **regular task** and has all the same fields and functionality, except for ‘Repetition Time’.

You can create a subtask by clicking on ‘Add New Sub-task’ and following the steps above for creating a task.

**When should I create a subtask?**

You would create one or more subtasks on a parent task in a scenario where you have a **large bucket of work or group of related processes that can be broken down into more manageable chunks of work**.

On the GECKO platform, you **won’t be able to close the parent task until all underlying subtasks have been marked as Complete**.

<img alt="Subtasks" src={useBaseUrl('img/subtasks.png')}/>

## Recurring Tasks

The GECKO platform allows you to create an individual task that recurs at specified time intervals.

**When should I create a recurring task?**

In contrast to the subtask functionality, you would use a recurring task if **you have a task or business process whereby similar work is carried out at frequent regular intervals**. E.g. filing a report to the Central Bank every month. 

**How do I create a recurring task?**

A task becomes a recurring task once you **select a Repetition Time when creating the task**. E.g. Repetition Time - Weekly.

**How do I trigger the task to recur?**

A task will automatically recur or repeat in two scenarios:

When the Due Date has been reached..

**OR**

on clicking 'Complete' in the task..

:::important note 
It’s worth noting here that if the original task contained any subtasks, the **same structure of ‘Parent task and its Subtasks’ will be created in the new task**.
:::

If the due date has been reached OR you have clicked Complete on a task, then **a new task will automatically be created with a new adjusted due date**. 

:::warning warning 
As the new task gets created, the previous task automatically gets **archived** and will be **hidden from view** in the Project Workflow Stage, or column.
:::

## Archived Tasks

A task gets archived only if it has been set up as a recurring task and the **due date has been reached** or an **assignee of the task has clicked Complete**.

**How do I view Archived Tasks?**

You can view an archived task by clicking on the **current or ‘in progress’ task in a recurring series of tasks**, then clicking on the ‘Previous Archived’ tab.


## Workflows

Workflows allows organisations to **examine their internal processes** and group them into **baskets or collections of related tasks**.

:::tip Best Practices
On the GECKO platform, we encourage our clients to sit down and take the time to **evaluate their internal business processes** and **group them into similar baskets**. These baskets become the ‘**Workflow Stages**’. 
:::

You can create workflows by clicking the ‘**Add Workflow**’ button.

You can also Edit/Delete existing workflows.

All projects are created using workflows, you can use a workflow as a template when creating new Projects.

## Categories

A Category is essentially a '**type**' of **Project**. On the Browse Projects screen you can *filter **Projects** by Category*. 

Within the Categories section you can also create the milestones associated with your projects.

You can Add new Categories or update and delete existing Categories.


## Clients

You can add new Clients by clicking ‘**Add Client**’.

Filter your client search by using the search functionality.


## Tag Management

You can add new Tags by clicking ‘**Add Tag**’.

When adding a Tag to a task - click in the tag field, select tag from the dropdown and click update tags.

Filter your tag search by using the search functionality.

:::tip Best Practise
We recommend to use tags as much as possible on tasks as it can give users an additional way to filter out tasks and generate report on them for specific user.
