## Registers

In the project details section, you will find the Registers. In the example provided, we have chosen a Register of Directors. 

Registers are easily created or edited to suit your needs. e.g. Register of Complaints, Register of Beneficial Owners, Authorised Signatory List, to name a few.

## Fund Details Dropdown

Where Project category ‘**Fund**’ has been selected, a dropdown of Fund related data will be displayed.

## Drag and Drop Workflow Columns

You can easily rearrange your Project workflow by **clicking and dragging** the top of a column. This functionality is dependent on your permission level.


## Drag and Drop Tasks

Drag and drop tasks into different stages of the workflow.

Users assigned to a task will receive email updates as you drag and drop their task into different stages of the workflow.

## Create a Task

Add a new task by clicking ‘**Add New**’ within a Workflow Stage.

A pop-up screen will appear where you enter or select the following data:

- **Task Title**
- **Period**
- **Repetition Time, i.e. Daily, Monthly, Annually**
- **Due Date**
- **Priority i.e. High, Low**
- **Description**


:::important Note 
At this point, you also have the ability to create a ***Checklist / To Do List***  within the task to track smaller related actions.
:::

:::tip tip
You can use the task **Period** field to specify the **period of time the work relates to**. This enables you to search for and report on the task based on **when the work was carried out**, rather than on the Due Date of the task.
:::

:::tip tip
**Priority**: We recommend using a priority level of **Medium for normal, day-to-day tasks**. Low and High priority can then be used accordingly. **Critical** would ideally be used on the **rare occasion** that a task merits such a priority. If the term Critical becomes overused - the word loses its meaning!
:::

You can then click ‘**Add Task**’.

## Update Tasks

You can **click** on a task to view it.

When you're on the Task View screen, you can make updates by clicking on a specific field then clicking the Tick to save your changes. Tooltips have been added to help you update the different fields.


Depending on your permission level, you can update and view the following:

- **Title**
- **Due Date**
- **Period**
- **Repetition Time**
- **Assignees**
- **Status**
- **Description**
- **Files** 
- **Checklists**
- **Tags**
- **Calls**
- **Audit**
- **Priority**
- **Subtasks**
- **Discussion**

:::tip tip
You can use the task **Period** field to specify the **period of time the work relates to**. This enables you to search for and report on the task based on **when the work was carried out**, rather than on the Due Date of the task.
:::


**Description**
All the additional details relating to a task in a project can go in here, which includes links,
references and other texts.

To insert a **link** in the **Description** field:
- Click on the **link icon** in the Description menu bar and select **Insert link**
- Copy and paste link URL into the **URL textbox**
- In the Text field, type the link text as you want it to appear in the Description
- Click **Confirm** to save your link


**File Upload**
You can upload any files / documents related to the task by simply ‘**dragging and dropping**’ or clicking ‘**Drop files here to upload**’.

**Discussion**
You can leave a comment on the bottom of the Task View screen, that all users assigned to the task can read.

**Checklist / To-Do List**
As mentioned above, you can create a Checklist / To-Do List within the task to track smaller related items.

:::tip best practise
The Checklist / To-Do list functionality allows you to assign specific users to an individual checklist item.
:::

**Tags** 
You can add multiple tags to a task. This powerful functionality makes it easy to search for or aggregate across tasks for reporting purposes.



**Calls** 
Schedule video conferencing meetings for your Board meetings.

**Task Audit Trail**
Each task has its own audit trail which tracks all updates made to that specific task.

:::important Note
The Audit trail stores all keystrokes and updates ever made to a Project/Task.  A separate Audit menu item tab is available if you wish to obtain a more comprehensive Audit across all Projects.

## Task Bulk Update

While we are building out the task bulk action functionality, you can now **select whether or not** you wish to **display a popup** when **completing a task** or **when deleting a checklist** or checklist item.

This functionality is **only available to Admin and Manager** level users and can be accessed via the **task view screen** or via the personal **User Preferences** menu item.

## Subtasks
A subtask is essentially just like a **regular task** and has all the same fields and functionality, except for ‘Repetition Time’.

You can create a subtask by clicking on ‘Add New Sub-task’ and following the steps above for creating a task.

**When should I create a subtask?**

- When you have a **large bucket of work** or group of related processes that **can be broken down** into more manageable **chunks of work**.
- When you have an **umbrella or parent task** that can **remain open for a long duration** of time and subtasks that occur on an ad hoc basis.


On the GECKO platform, you **won’t be able to close the parent task until all underlying subtasks have been marked as Complete**.

#### Subtasks Demo

## Recurring Tasks

The GECKO platform allows you to create an individual task that recurs at specified time intervals.

**When should I create a recurring task?**

In contrast to the subtask functionality, you would use a recurring task if **you have a task or business process whereby similar work is carried out at frequent regular intervals**. E.g. filing a report to the Central Bank every month. 

**How do I create a recurring task?**

A task becomes a recurring task once you **select a Repetition Time when creating the task**. E.g. Repetition Time - Weekly.

**How do I trigger the task to recur?**

A task will automatically recur or repeat in two scenarios:

When the Due Date has been reached..

**OR**

on clicking 'Complete' in the task..

:::important note 
It’s worth noting here that if the original task contained any subtasks, the **same structure of ‘Parent task and its Subtasks’ will be created in the new task**.
:::

If the due date has been reached OR you have clicked Complete on a task, then **a new task will automatically be created with a new adjusted due date**. 

:::warning warning 
When an **In Progress** recurring task gets marked as **Complete**, it will become **hidden** from view in the Project Workflow Stage, or column
:::

## Project Archiving

You can Archive a Project by clicking the **Project Options dropdown** and selecting ‘**Archive Project**’. An Archived label will be displayed on the Project.

The tasks within your Archived Project will now remain in a **Read-Only** state until the Project is Unarchived. The tasks will no longer show up across the application or be included in reporting, i.e. on the Dashboard, on the Tasks quick finder tab, etc.

**How do I view Archived Projects?**

You can view all Archived Projects by navigating to **Browse Projects** and clicking ‘**Archive**’.

**How do I Unarchive a Project?**

You can Unarchive a Project by clicking the **Project Options dropdown** and selecting ‘**Unarchive Project**’.

## Workflows

Workflows allows organisations to **examine their internal processes** and group them into **baskets or collections of related tasks**.

:::tip Best Practices
On the GECKO platform, we encourage our clients to sit down and take the time to **evaluate their internal business processes** and **group them into similar baskets**. These baskets become the ‘**Workflow Stages**’. 
:::

You can create workflows by clicking the ‘**Add Workflow**’ button.

You can also Edit/Delete existing workflows.

All projects are created using workflows, you can use a workflow as a template when creating new Projects.

## Categories

A Category is essentially a '**type**' of **Project**. On the Browse Projects screen you can *filter **Projects** by Category*. 

Within the Categories section you can also create the milestones associated with your projects.

You can Add new Categories or update and delete existing Categories.

#### Add Categories

## Tag Management

You can add new Tags by clicking ‘**Add Tag**’.

When adding a Tag to a task - click in the tag field, select tag from the dropdown and click update tags.

Filter your tag search by using the search functionality.

:::tip Best Practise
We recommend to use tags as much as possible on tasks as it can give users an additional way to filter out tasks and generate report on them for specific user.
