## Workflows

:::tip Best Practices
On the GECKO platform, we encourage our clients to sit down and take the time to **evaluate their internal business processes** and **group them into similar baskets**. These baskets become the ‘**Workflow Stages**’. 
:::

Click ‘**Add Workflow**’ to create a new Workflow.

Workflows lay the foundation for your Workspaces. You will select a workflow when creating a new Workspace.
#### Add Workflow

  width="100%"
  controls="true"/>

## Categories

Click ’Add Category’ to create a new Category

Categories add an extra level of filtering when searching for Workspaces.
## Clients

Click ’Add Client’ to create a new Client.

## Tags

Click ‘**Add Tag**’ to create a new Tag.


:::tip Best Practice
We recommend our clients start with 10 - 15 Tags to encourage consistency across business processes and reporting. Further Tags can be added as use cases become more refined within the GECKO system.
::: 


#### Some example Tags to consider
- Reviewed
- No Issue Found
- No Comment
- Complete - No Material Issues
- Red Flag

Please contact a member of the GECKO team if you would like to discuss Tags that are more specific to your business processes.
