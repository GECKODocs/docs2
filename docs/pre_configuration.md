## Workflows

:::tip Best Practices
On the GECKO platform, we encourage our clients to sit down and take the time to **evaluate their internal business processes** and **group them into similar baskets**. These baskets become the ‘**Workflow Stages**’. 
:::

You can create workflows by clicking the ‘**Add Workflow**’ button.

You can also Edit/Delete existing workflows.

All projects are created using workflows, you can use a workflow as a template when creating new Projects.

#### Add Workflow
