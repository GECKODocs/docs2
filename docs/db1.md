## Navigation Menu

To get started, the first thing to do while familiarising yourself with the GECKO platform is to **explore** the **navigation menu** and work your way around the different areas of functionality.

It’s a scrollable menu that can be hidden using the hamburger menu as a toggle ‘menu on/off’ button.

## Main Dashboard


- **Open Tasks** - Number of open tasks on the platform. Task visibility is based on user permissions.
- **Completed Tasks** - Number of complete tasks on the platform. Task visibility is based on user permissions.
- **Create** a New Project / Fund.
- **Manage** fund Categories, Workflows and Users.
- **Filter** by Project   
  - R.A.G Rating (Red, Amber, Green) piechart aggregation, filtering on Task Status within a specified Fund   or Project. i.e. A centralised, birdseye view of tasks that are Complete, In Progress or Overdue. Task visibility is based on user permissions.

## Activities Pie Chart

You can **hover your mouse** over the **pie chart** to view the **number of tasks** Overdue, In Progress and Completed. Click on the pie chart to be brought to the underlying details of the activities.

E.g. If you select ‘**Overdue**’, you are directed to the ‘**Activity**’ page, where you can view the details of all tasks which currently have their status’ marked as overdue. In our example we have 2 overdue tasks. You can action them on the right-hand side column. You can also use the filter function or search functionality to look for tasks within a project and their status.

:::tip tip
This Pie chart acts as a KPI, we can work with you to customize different graph types if desired to help you drill down your inefficiencies.
